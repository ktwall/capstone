# This is for my final Capstone Project for UF. For this assignment I am creating an application called ReadySetTravel. 

# ReadySetTravel

This is an application called ReadySetTravel. The goal of this application is to provide a user-friendly travel countdown app designed to simplify the process of tracking planned trips. In today's world, managing travel plans across various platforms can feel overwhelming, leading to stress and disorganization. ReadySetTravel aims to alleviate these challenges by providing a centralized platform where users can easily input, track, and count down to their upcoming trips.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Trip Input and Management**
  - Add the trip's name and destination.
  - Select the calendar date for the trip.
  - Include relevant travel details such as flights or hotel bookings in a form field.
  - Enter the official city name to access weather data in Mockable.
- **Weather Forecasts**
  - Fetch static weather forecasts for trip destinations using Postman as the API development environment, ensuring users stay informed about weather conditions.
- **Countdown Timers**
  - Calculate and display countdown timers for each trip, providing a visual representation of the days remaining until departure to enhance the travel experience.

## Technology Stack

- **API Development Environment**
  - Postman (https://www.postman.com/): Used to design, test, and document the API endpoints.
- **Static Database**
  - Mockable (https://www.mockable.io/): Used to create a mock database for weather data without the complexities of setting up a full database server.

## API Endpoints

### Weather Data
- **GET /api/weather**: Endpoint to fetch weather data for a given location. This will utilize the mock database created in Mockable to provide weather forecasts.

## Deployment

I plan to host the application on gardensgymnastics.com - this may be updated in the future.
